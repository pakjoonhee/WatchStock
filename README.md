# StockHawk

StockHawk is an app that allows the user to track their favorite stocks. The user can add stocks with the plus button,
and the program will tell the user whether the stock already exists or never has existed. For every stock the user is
tracking, the user is presented with a graph that shows the stocks price over time.

Data was sourced from the Yahoo Stock History API.
